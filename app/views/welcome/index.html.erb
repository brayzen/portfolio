            <h3>About me:</h3>
            <!-- <p>My overarching passion in life is helping others discover and find abundance through their own passions. I believe the world will be a much better place when people are taught, encouraged, and coached to achieve success within the things we love doing.</p> -->

            <p>I’m a developer who is passionate about software, people and products that enable us to connect to the things we want in life.  I come from a project management and sales background and I’m most interested in launching peoples’ ideas/passions.  I want to master the process of idea to worthwhile business, and then do it over and over and over.</p>

            <h3>Why work with me?:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>I prefer my hands be dirty.</strong>  I’ll be the developer doing the things most are afraid of, or don’t like doing.  I’m focused on the overall product and I want to see it succeed, so use me wherever, I won’t bat an eye.   Well working robust code gives me a great sense of accomplishment.</li>
              <li><strong>Effective, authentic, and engaging communication is my game.</strong> I love people and public speaking, so let me present, especially the technical presentation.</li>
              <li><strong>Translation from Customer to Code (1XUX).</strong>  A great product communicates ease and value to the Customer’s intuition.  I’ll consult with real users in order to craft a seamless experience they’ll recommend to their friends.
- I’m invigorated to solve problems. Give me all the troubleshooting.</li></li>
              <li></strong>I aim to align goals.</strong>  The more aligned the common goal is with the individual goal, the more innovation, creativity, and effort you’ll get from each team member.  More people with the same goal equals more power.  You can count on me to bring consistent uplifting energy that brings teams together and reduces turnover.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Problem domain:</h3>
            <p>I'm captivated by Information Technology and enthralled with the computer's ability to track, compute, and organize data.  I'm facinated with the mind, it's programmatic loop, and it's impact on perception.  I aim to create products that build awareness and provide focus for the individual.  I believe A.I. has a significant role to play in personal development.</p>
