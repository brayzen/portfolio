          <h4>What's a 'BAR RAISER'?</h4>


          <p>The bar raiser I look for is the individual who brings consistant almost gauranteed positive energy into my workspace.  I want employees who adapt, flex, bend, but also assert their ownership in everything they do.  I don't want order takers, I want someone who challenges the methods we have and is doing what is best per situation.  The habit should be in doing what is best, not in doing it the way its always been done.  This bar raiser should be adept at communicating so a wave of inspiration radiates througout the team.  I want team players that encourage, collaborate, and corroborate with other team members, thus making my team better.  I'm looking for leaders in leadership.</p>

          <p>My overarching passion in life is helping others discover and find abundance through their own unique passions. I believe the world will be a much better place when people are taught, encouraged, and coached to achieve success within their passions.<p>

          <p>I'm captivated by the computer's ability to track, compute, and provide data.  I'm facinated with the mind, pathology and its direct result of life's experience.  I aim to create products that build awareness and provide focus for the individual's mind.  I believe A.I. and robots have a significant role to play in personal development.</p>

          <p>If you want a 'bar raiser' with a track record for growth, a team player with proven communication skills, and a leader who desires his team win before himself, its a pleasure to meet you.

          <p>I've done my best to become the '<strong><em>bar raiser</em></strong>' I would want on my team.</p>
