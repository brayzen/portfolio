PORTFOLIO

The purpose of this application is to showcase the skill sets I've learned throughout the RubyOnRails Development Accelerator offered by Code Fellows.

DAY2 of the Ruby Dev Accelerator was about minimal testiing

DAY 3 was an intense day revolving around BDD.  Fail, Pass, then refactor.  We used scaffolding to create the magic nessasary to pass our tests.  Also worked with fixtures so we didn't have to .create new articles within our test files.
